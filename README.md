# Web Audio Components

This is an experiment using the Web Audio API and WebComponents with vanilla javascript.

## Installation and running

* No `npm install` (for now). 
* `npm start` uses PHP to start a development web server. If you don't want to use PHP, fair alternatives are `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` or the node [http-server](https://npmjs.com/package/http-server).
